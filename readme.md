# Resizing Video Content on scroll

Just practicing resizing a video tag when the user scrolls from the top of the page. This kind of feature is common with digital media publications.

Used CSS transition and vanilla JS to create a flag variable `shouldResize` that would be changed to `true` when the `scrollTop` value is greater than 1.
